Client:
QueryableStateClient

 * Client for querying Flink's managed state.
 *
 * <p>You can mark state as queryable via {@link StateDescriptor#setQueryable(String)}.
 * The state instance created from this descriptor will be published for queries when it's
 * created on the Task Managers and the location will be reported to the Job Manager.
 *
 * <p>The client connects to a {@code Client Proxy} running on a given Task Manager. The
 * proxy is the entry point of the client to the Flink cluster. It forwards the requests
 * of the client to the Job Manager and the required Task Manager, and forwards the final
 * response back the client.
 *
 * <p>The proxy, initially resolves the location of the requested KvState via the JobManager. Resolved
 * locations are cached. When the server address of the requested KvState instance is determined, the
 * client sends out a request to the server. The returned final answer is then forwarded to the Client.
